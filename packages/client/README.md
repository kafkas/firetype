# Firetype Client

Firetype is a lightweight TypeScript library that lets you strictly type your Firebase architecture.

Firetype Client wraps the [Firebase JS SDK](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk) in a way that lets you provide a set of types describing your data so you can prevent bugs, errors and crashes at compile time. It remembers the "schema" that you feed to it and stops you from writing bad code. This, combined with the ease with which it lets you bring changes to your codebase, provides a great developer experience.
